# ISC2U-shapegame

### Description: 
In 2019, my partner and I coded a video game for our grade 10 summative project. The goal was to create an educational game for elementary school students. We collaborated with a nearby school and met with an elementary student to design the game. The student provided artwork, and we incorporated simple math problems into the game. After developing the game, we presented it to the elementary school students for feedback and testing.

### How to play: 
the goal of the game is to identify basic polygons, by click on the correct ones as they fall down the screen. If a mistake is made you will be presented with a simple math problem as a penalty.
